dotAstronomy Hack Submission App
================================

This is a web app to submit to the dotAstronomy hack list: https://github.com/dotastro/hacks-collector .

Note for future dotAstronomy's: before the hack day stars, be sure to add an appropriate entry to `dotastro_hack_submission/templates/form-validation.html` in the "dotastronumber" select tag. You'll probably also have to push to the heroku app, not just the github (unless someone sets up the github connection).
